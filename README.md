# AD9854 C library
C library for the AD9854 digital synthesizer

The library is ready to use with the Arduino or RTOS ESP-IDF framework, but should work with others as well.
To work with this library you need an SPI bus driver, for Arduino and RTOS you can find it in the examples.
You can also use a ready-made driver and add your own section in ad9854.h
Currently the library is tested with AD9854ASQ.
